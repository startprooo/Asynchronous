# Asynchronous Multi-Agent System - AI Development Guide

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

This is a sophisticated multi-agent system combining:
- Core agent orchestration (`src/agents/`)
- Browser automation (`src/browser/`)
- Model Context Protocol servers (`src/mcp/`)
- Web API layer (`src/controllers/`)
- Next.js frontend (`frontend/`)

Key patterns:
- Event-driven communication using EventEmitter
- Redis for state persistence
- WebSocket for real-time updates
- TypeScript throughout with strict typing

## üíª Development Workflow

1. **Environment Setup**
```bash
npm install        # Install dependencies
cp .env.example .env
# Configure: REDIS_URL, OPENAI_API_KEY
```

2. **Development**
```bash
npm run dev     # Start dev server with hot reload
```

3. **Testing**
- Unit tests: `src/**/*.spec.ts`
- Integration tests: `test/integration/`
- E2E tests use Playwright

## üîë Key Components

### Agent System (`src/agents/AgentManager.ts`)
- Manages multiple AI agents with different capabilities
- Uses Redis for agent state persistence
- Agent interface:
```typescript
interface Agent {
    id: string;
    capabilities: string[];
    status: 'idle' | 'busy' | 'paused';
    memory: {
        shortTerm: any[];
        workingMemory: Record<string, any>;
    };
}
```

### MCP Server (`src/mcp/MCPServer.ts`)
- Implements Model Context Protocol
- Handles model loading and generation
- Extensible handler system:
  - model.load
  - model.generate
  - model.stream

### Browser Automation (`src/browser/BrowserAutomation.ts`)
- Uses Playwright for web automation
- Supports Chrome, Firefox, WebKit
- Manages browser lifecycle and sessions

### Frontend (`frontend/`)
- Next.js 14+ with App Router
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Real-time updates via WebSocket
- Component structure:
  - `src/app/` - Pages and layouts
  - `src/components/` - Reusable UI components
  - `src/lib/` - Utilities and hooks

## üìù Conventions

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Classes are decorated with @Injectable() for DI
- Event handlers use EventEmitter pattern
- Services handle business logic
- Controllers handle HTTP routing

### State Management
- Redis for persistent state
- In-memory Maps for runtime state
- WebSocket for real-time updates

### Error Handling
- Use typed exceptions
- Handle async errors with try/catch
- Log errors through service layer

## üîÑ Common Workflows

1. **Adding New Agent Capability**
   - Define capability in `Agent` interface
   - Add handler in `AgentManager`
   - Register in Redis state

2. **Extending MCP Server**
   - Add new handler method
   - Register in `registerDefaultHandlers()`
   - Update type definitions

3. **Frontend Changes**
   - Components in `frontend/src/components/`
   - Pages in `frontend/src/app/`
   - Styles with Tailwind in `globals.css`

## üö´ Anti-patterns to Avoid

- Don't bypass the AgentManager for agent operations
- Don't directly manipulate Redis state outside services
- Don't mix browser automation with business logic
- Don't handle WebSocket events outside designated handlers

Performance isn't just a buzzword‚Äîit's the difference between a product people love and one they abandon. I've seen firsthand how a slow app can frustrate users, rack up cloud bills, and even lose customers. This guide is a living collection of the most effective, real-world performance practices I've used and reviewed, covering frontend, backend, and database layers, as well as advanced topics. Use it as a reference, a checklist, and a source of inspiration for building fast, efficient, and scalable software.

General Principles
Measure First, Optimize Second: Always profile and measure before optimizing. Use benchmarks, profilers, and monitoring tools to identify real bottlenecks. Guessing is the enemy of performance.
Pro Tip: Use tools like Chrome DevTools, Lighthouse, New Relic, Datadog, Py-Spy, or your language's built-in profilers.
Optimize for the Common Case: Focus on optimizing code paths that are most frequently executed. Don't waste time on rare edge cases unless they're critical.
Avoid Premature Optimization: Write clear, maintainable code first; optimize only when necessary. Premature optimization can make code harder to read and maintain.
Minimize Resource Usage: Use memory, CPU, network, and disk resources efficiently. Always ask: "Can this be done with less?"
Prefer Simplicity: Simple algorithms and data structures are often faster and easier to optimize. Don't over-engineer.
Document Performance Assumptions: Clearly comment on any code that is performance-critical or has non-obvious optimizations. Future maintainers (including you) will thank you.
Understand the Platform: Know the performance characteristics of your language, framework, and runtime. What's fast in Python may be slow in JavaScript, and vice versa.
Automate Performance Testing: Integrate performance tests and benchmarks into your CI/CD pipeline. Catch regressions early.
Set Performance Budgets: Define acceptable limits for load time, memory usage, API latency, etc. Enforce them with automated checks.
Frontend Performance
Rendering and DOM
Minimize DOM Manipulations: Batch updates where possible. Frequent DOM changes are expensive.
Anti-pattern: Updating the DOM in a loop. Instead, build a document fragment and append it once.
Virtual DOM Frameworks: Use React, Vue, or similar efficiently‚Äîavoid unnecessary re-renders.
React Example: Use React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback to prevent unnecessary renders.
Keys in Lists: Always use stable keys in lists to help virtual DOM diffing. Avoid using array indices as keys unless the list is static.
Avoid Inline Styles: Inline styles can trigger layout thrashing. Prefer CSS classes.
CSS Animations: Use CSS transitions/animations over JavaScript for smoother, GPU-accelerated effects.
Defer Non-Critical Rendering: Use requestIdleCallback or similar to defer work until the browser is idle.
Asset Optimization
Image Compression: Use tools like ImageOptim, Squoosh, or TinyPNG. Prefer modern formats (WebP, AVIF) for web delivery.
SVGs for Icons: SVGs scale well and are often smaller than PNGs for simple graphics.
Minification and Bundling: Use Webpack, Rollup, or esbuild to bundle and minify JS/CSS. Enable tree-shaking to remove dead code.
Cache Headers: Set long-lived cache headers for static assets. Use cache busting for updates.
Lazy Loading: Use loading="lazy" for images, and dynamic imports for JS modules/components.
Font Optimization: Use only the character sets you need. Subset fonts and use font-display: swap.
Network Optimization
Reduce HTTP Requests: Combine files, use image sprites, and inline critical CSS.
HTTP/2 and HTTP/3: Enable these protocols for multiplexing and lower latency.
Client-Side Caching: Use Service Workers, IndexedDB, and localStorage for offline and repeat visits.
CDNs: Serve static assets from a CDN close to your users. Use multiple CDNs for redundancy.
Defer/Async Scripts: Use defer or async for non-critical JS to avoid blocking rendering.
Preload and Prefetch: Use <link rel="preload"> and <link rel="prefetch"> for critical resources.
JavaScript Performance
Avoid Blocking the Main Thread: Offload heavy computation to Web Workers.
Debounce/Throttle Events: For scroll, resize, and input events, use debounce/throttle to limit handler frequency.
Memory Leaks: Clean up event listeners, intervals, and DOM references. Use browser dev tools to check for detached nodes.
Efficient Data Structures: Use Maps/Sets for lookups, TypedArrays for numeric data.
Avoid Global Variables: Globals can cause memory leaks and unpredictable performance.
Avoid Deep Object Cloning: Use shallow copies or libraries like lodash's cloneDeep only when necessary.
Accessibility and Performance
Accessible Components: Ensure ARIA updates are not excessive. Use semantic HTML for both accessibility and performance.
Screen Reader Performance: Avoid rapid DOM updates that can overwhelm assistive tech.
Framework-Specific Tips
React
Use React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback to avoid unnecessary renders.
Split large components and use code-splitting (React.lazy, Suspense).
Avoid anonymous functions in render; they create new references on every render.
Use ErrorBoundary to catch and handle errors gracefully.
Profile with React DevTools Profiler.
Angular
Use OnPush change detection for components that don't need frequent updates.
Avoid complex expressions in templates; move logic to the component class.
Use trackBy in ngFor for efficient list rendering.
Lazy load modules and components with the Angular Router.
Profile with Angular DevTools.
Vue
Use computed properties over methods in templates for caching.
Use v-show vs v-if appropriately (v-show is better for toggling visibility frequently).
Lazy load components and routes with Vue Router.
Profile with Vue Devtools.
Common Frontend Pitfalls
Loading large JS bundles on initial page load.
Not compressing images or using outdated formats.
Failing to clean up event listeners, causing memory leaks.
Overusing third-party libraries for simple tasks.
Ignoring mobile performance (test on real devices!).
Frontend Troubleshooting
Use Chrome DevTools' Performance tab to record and analyze slow frames.
Use Lighthouse to audit performance and get actionable suggestions.
Use WebPageTest for real-world load testing.
Monitor Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) for user-centric metrics.
Backend Performance
Algorithm and Data Structure Optimization
Choose the Right Data Structure: Arrays for sequential access, hash maps for fast lookups, trees for hierarchical data, etc.
Efficient Algorithms: Use binary search, quicksort, or hash-based algorithms where appropriate.
Avoid O(n^2) or Worse: Profile nested loops and recursive calls. Refactor to reduce complexity.
Batch Processing: Process data in batches to reduce overhead (e.g., bulk database inserts).
Streaming: Use streaming APIs for large data sets to avoid loading everything into memory.
Concurrency and Parallelism
Asynchronous I/O: Use async/await, callbacks, or event loops to avoid blocking threads.
Thread/Worker Pools: Use pools to manage concurrency and avoid resource exhaustion.
Avoid Race Conditions: Use locks, semaphores, or atomic operations where needed.
Bulk Operations: Batch network/database calls to reduce round trips.
Backpressure: Implement backpressure in queues and pipelines to avoid overload.
Caching
Cache Expensive Computations: Use in-memory caches (Redis, Memcached) for hot data.
Cache Invalidation: Use time-based (TTL), event-based, or manual invalidation. Stale cache is worse than no cache.
Distributed Caching: For multi-server setups, use distributed caches and be aware of consistency issues.
Cache Stampede Protection: Use locks or request coalescing to prevent thundering herd problems.
Don't Cache Everything: Some data is too volatile or sensitive to cache.
API and Network
Minimize Payloads: Use JSON, compress responses (gzip, Brotli), and avoid sending unnecessary data.
Pagination: Always paginate large result sets. Use cursors for real-time data.
Rate Limiting: Protect APIs from abuse and overload.
Connection Pooling: Reuse connections for databases and external services.
Protocol Choice: Use HTTP/2, gRPC, or WebSockets for high-throughput, low-latency communication.
Logging and Monitoring
Minimize Logging in Hot Paths: Excessive logging can slow down critical code.
Structured Logging: Use JSON or key-value logs for easier parsing and analysis.
Monitor Everything: Latency, throughput, error rates, resource usage. Use Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, or similar.
Alerting: Set up alerts for performance regressions and resource exhaustion.
Language/Framework-Specific Tips
Node.js
Use asynchronous APIs; avoid blocking the event loop (e.g., never use fs.readFileSync in production).
Use clustering or worker threads for CPU-bound tasks.
Limit concurrent open connections to avoid resource exhaustion.
Use streams for large file or network data processing.
Profile with clinic.js, node --inspect, or Chrome DevTools.
Python
Use built-in data structures (dict, set, deque) for speed.
Profile with cProfile, line_profiler, or Py-Spy.
Use multiprocessing or asyncio for parallelism.
Avoid GIL bottlenecks in CPU-bound code; use C extensions or subprocesses.
Use lru_cache for memoization.
Java
Use efficient collections (ArrayList, HashMap, etc.).
Profile with VisualVM, JProfiler, or YourKit.
Use thread pools (Executors) for concurrency.
Tune JVM options for heap and garbage collection (-Xmx, -Xms, -XX:+UseG1GC).
Use CompletableFuture for async programming.
.NET
Use async/await for I/O-bound operations.
Use Span<T> and Memory<T> for efficient memory access.
Profile with dotTrace, Visual Studio Profiler, or PerfView.
Pool objects and connections where appropriate.
Use IAsyncEnumerable<T> for streaming data.
Common Backend Pitfalls
Synchronous/blocking I/O in web servers.
Not using connection pooling for databases.
Over-caching or caching sensitive/volatile data.
Ignoring error handling in async code.
Not monitoring or alerting on performance regressions.
Backend Troubleshooting
Use flame graphs to visualize CPU usage.
Use distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, Zipkin) to track request latency across services.
Use heap dumps and memory profilers to find leaks.
Log slow queries and API calls for analysis.
Database Performance
Query Optimization
Indexes: Use indexes on columns that are frequently queried, filtered, or joined. Monitor index usage and drop unused indexes.
*Avoid SELECT : Select only the columns you need. Reduces I/O and memory usage.
Parameterized Queries: Prevent SQL injection and improve plan caching.
Query Plans: Analyze and optimize query execution plans. Use EXPLAIN in SQL databases.
Avoid N+1 Queries: Use joins or batch queries to avoid repeated queries in loops.
Limit Result Sets: Use LIMIT/OFFSET or cursors for large tables.
Schema Design
Normalization: Normalize to reduce redundancy, but denormalize for read-heavy workloads if needed.
Data Types: Use the most efficient data types and set appropriate constraints.
Partitioning: Partition large tables for scalability and manageability.
Archiving: Regularly archive or purge old data to keep tables small and fast.
Foreign Keys: Use them for data integrity, but be aware of performance trade-offs in high-write scenarios.
Transactions
Short Transactions: Keep transactions as short as possible to reduce lock contention.
Isolation Levels: Use the lowest isolation level that meets your consistency needs.
Avoid Long-Running Transactions: They can block other operations and increase deadlocks.
Caching and Replication
Read Replicas: Use for scaling read-heavy workloads. Monitor replication lag.
Cache Query Results: Use Redis or Memcached for frequently accessed queries.
Write-Through/Write-Behind: Choose the right strategy for your consistency needs.
Sharding: Distribute data across multiple servers for scalability.
NoSQL Databases
Design for Access Patterns: Model your data for the queries you need.
Avoid Hot Partitions: Distribute writes/reads evenly.
Unbounded Growth: Watch for unbounded arrays or documents.
Sharding and Replication: Use for scalability and availability.
Consistency Models: Understand eventual vs strong consistency and choose appropriately.
Common Database Pitfalls
Missing or unused indexes.
SELECT * in production queries.
Not monitoring slow queries.
Ignoring replication lag.
Not archiving old data.
Database Troubleshooting
Use slow query logs to identify bottlenecks.
Use EXPLAIN to analyze query plans.
Monitor cache hit/miss ratios.
Use database-specific monitoring tools (pg_stat_statements, MySQL Performance Schema).

Advanced Topics
Profiling and Benchmarking
Profilers: Use language-specific profilers (Chrome DevTools, Py-Spy, VisualVM, dotTrace, etc.) to identify bottlenecks.
Microbenchmarks: Write microbenchmarks for critical code paths. Use benchmark.js, pytest-benchmark, or JMH for Java.
A/B Testing: Measure real-world impact of optimizations with A/B or canary releases.

Object Pooling: Use for frequently created/destroyed objects (e.g., DB connections, threads).
Heap Monitoring: Monitor heap usage and garbage collection. Tune GC settings for your workload.
Memory Leaks: Use leak detection tools (Valgrind, LeakCanary, Chrome DevTools).
Scalability
Horizontal Scaling: Design stateless services, use sharding/partitioning, and load balancers.
Auto-Scaling: Use cloud auto-scaling groups and set sensible thresholds.
Bottleneck Analysis: Identify and address single points of failure.
Distributed Systems: Use idempotent operations, retries, and circuit breakers.
Security and Performance
Efficient Crypto: Use hardware-accelerated and well-maintained cryptographic libraries.
Validation: Validate inputs efficiently; avoid regexes in hot paths.
Rate Limiting: Protect against DoS without harming legitimate users.
Mobile Performance
Startup Time: Lazy load features, defer heavy work, and minimize initial bundle size.
Image/Asset Optimization: Use responsive images and compress assets for mobile bandwidth.
Efficient Storage: Use SQLite, Realm, or platform-optimized storage.
Profiling: Use Android Profiler, Instruments (iOS), or Firebase Performance Monitoring.
Cloud and Serverless
Cold Starts: Minimize dependencies and keep functions warm.
Resource Allocation: Tune memory/CPU for serverless functions.
Managed Services: Use managed caching, queues, and DBs for scalability.
Cost Optimization: Monitor and optimize for cloud cost as a performance metric.
Practical Examples
Example 1: Debouncing User Input in JavaScript
// BAD: Triggers API call on every keystroke
input.addEventListener('input', (e) => {
  fetch(`/search?q=${e.target.value}`);
});

// GOOD: Debounce API calls
let timeout;
input.addEventListener('input', (e) => {
  clearTimeout(timeout);
  timeout = setTimeout(() => {
    fetch(`/search?q=${e.target.value}`);
  }, 300);
});
Example 2: Efficient SQL Query
-- BAD: Selects all columns and does not use an index
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'user@example.com';

-- GOOD: Selects only needed columns and uses an index
SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
Example 3: Caching Expensive Computation in Python
# BAD: Recomputes result every time
result = expensive_function(x)

# GOOD: Cache result
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=128)
def expensive_function(x):
    ...
result = expensive_function(x)
Example 4: Lazy Loading Images in HTML
<!-- BAD: Loads all images immediately -->
<img src="large-image.jpg" />

<!-- GOOD: Lazy loads images -->
<img src="large-image.jpg" loading="lazy" />
Example 5: Asynchronous I/O in Node.js
// BAD: Blocking file read
const data = fs.readFileSync('file.txt');

// GOOD: Non-blocking file read
fs.readFile('file.txt', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  // process data
});
Example 6: Profiling a Python Function
import cProfile
import pstats

def slow_function():
    ...

cProfile.run('slow_function()', 'profile.stats')
p = pstats.Stats('profile.stats')
p.sort_stats('cumulative').print_stats(10)
Example 7: Using Redis for Caching in Node.js
const redis = require('redis');
const client = redis.createClient();

function getCachedData(key, fetchFunction) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    client.get(key, (err, data) => {
      if (data) return resolve(JSON.parse(data));
      fetchFunction().then(result => {
        client.setex(key, 3600, JSON.stringify(result));
        resolve(result);
      });
    });
  });
}

Code Quality Standards
Locators: Prioritize user-facing, role-based locators (getByRole, getByLabel, getByText, etc.) for resilience and accessibility. Use test.step() to group interactions and improve test readability and reporting.
Assertions: Use auto-retrying web-first assertions. These assertions start with the await keyword (e.g., await expect(locator).toHaveText()). Avoid expect(locator).toBeVisible() unless specifically testing for visibility changes.
Timeouts: Rely on Playwright's built-in auto-waiting mechanisms. Avoid hard-coded waits or increased default timeouts.
Clarity: Use descriptive test and step titles that clearly state the intent. Add comments only to explain complex logic or non-obvious interactions.
Test Structure
Imports: Start with import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';.
Organization: Group related tests for a feature under a test.describe() block.
Hooks: Use beforeEach for setup actions common to all tests in a describe block (e.g., navigating to a page).
Titles: Follow a clear naming convention, such as Feature - Specific action or scenario.
File Organization
Location: Store all test files in the tests/ directory.
Naming: Use the convention <feature-or-page>.spec.ts (e.g., login.spec.ts, search.spec.ts).
Scope: Aim for one test file per major application feature or page.
Assertion Best Practices
UI Structure: Use toMatchAriaSnapshot to verify the accessibility tree structure of a component. This provides a comprehensive and accessible snapshot.
Element Counts: Use toHaveCount to assert the number of elements found by a locator.
Text Content: Use toHaveText for exact text matches and toContainText for partial matches.
Navigation: Use toHaveURL to verify the page URL after an action.
Example Test Structure
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('Movie Search Feature', () => {
  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    // Navigate to the application before each test
    await page.goto('https://debs-obrien.github.io/playwright-movies-app');
  });

  test('Search for a movie by title', async ({ page }) => {
    await test.step('Activate and perform search', async () => {
      await page.getByRole('search').click();
      const searchInput = page.getByRole('textbox', { name: 'Search Input' });
      await searchInput.fill('Garfield');
      await searchInput.press('Enter');
    });

    await test.step('Verify search results', async () => {
      // Verify the accessibility tree of the search results
      await expect(page.getByRole('main')).toMatchAriaSnapshot(`
        - main:
          - heading "Garfield" [level=1]
          - heading "search results" [level=2]
          - list "movies":
            - listitem "movie":
              - link "poster of The Garfield Movie The Garfield Movie rating":
                - /url: /playwright-movies-app/movie?id=tt5779228&page=1
                - img "poster of The Garfield Movie"
                - heading "The Garfield Movie" [level=2]
      `);
    });
  });
});
Test Execution Strategy
Initial Run: Execute tests with npx playwright test --project=chromium
Debug Failures: Analyze test failures and identify root causes
Iterate: Refine locators, assertions, or test logic as needed
Validate: Ensure tests pass consistently and cover the intended functionality
Report: Provide feedback on test results and any issues discovered
Quality Checklist
Before finalizing tests, ensure:

 All locators are accessible and specific and avoid strict mode violations
 Tests are grouped logically and follow a clear structure
 Assertions are meaningful and reflect user expectations
 Tests follow consistent naming conventions
 Code is properly formatted and commented
